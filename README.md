HealthSync is a secure platform designed to facilitate seamless data exchange between doctors, patients, and insurance providers. The system ensures privacy and integrity of health data through robust authentication and role-based authorization. Built with a microservices architecture, it handles image uploads and uses dual databases (MySQL and MongoDB) to efficiently store structured and unstructured data. In this project, I used a microservices architecture, I have created a separate branch for each microservice.
